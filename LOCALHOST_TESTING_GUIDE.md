## üö® If You Find Issues

1. **Check the browser console** for specific error messages
2. **Note which page** the issue occurs on
3. **Try to reproduce** the issue consistently
4. **Test in incognito mode** to rule out cache issues

Remember: We only removed unused packages and replaced SweetAlert2 with native dialogs. All core functionality should work exactly as before!
